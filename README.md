CoffeeScript Wordcloud
======================

This small CoffeeScript script draws the wordcloud into a [RaphaÃ«l][raphael]
canvas. The source is well documented (for my standards anyway) and is very
short so it should be very easy to follow and understand.

The algorithm was stolen^Wcopied from [PyTagCloud][pytagcloud].

Before you open index.html, please make sure to compile the wordcloud.coffee
source file: `coffee -c wordcloud.coffee`.
